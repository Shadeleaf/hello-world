# hello-world
Hello everyone in GitHub!
I am a new coder who self-learned (with help from my brother) HTML and a litle bit of CSS. I'm not very good at anything just yet, but let's just say that Google is very helpful these days! :)
I love reading, writing, typing, and sketching things. Maybe one day I'll change the world. ;)
